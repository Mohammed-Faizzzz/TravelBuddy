# TravelBuddy
TravelBuddy is a mobile app built using React Native. It requires users to fill up a form whereby they detail their intended period of stay, countries that they wish to visit, their flight schedule, hotels, etc. TravelBuddy then generates a recommended itinerary based on these inputs.

Future extensions include: 
- an explore page where popular itineraries are displayed for users to consider (based on their searches)
- collaboration with friends/sharing itineraries with friends to plan a trip together (WIP)
- making using of APIs available to also suggest flight tickets and accomodations according to the user's preference
